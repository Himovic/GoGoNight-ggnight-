# GoGoNight-ggnight-
ggnight is a web application that allows you to organize events like birthdays and meetings.

How ggnight works ? : In registration, you have to put some preferences about what you want to eat and your transportation. To organize an event, you need to have friends and invite them, this is why i create a friend managment to add and delete friends. In organization module, i used Google Maps API to show restaurants, bars and/or night clubs based on your preferences and preferences of your friends in area of 10Km to move less.

Technologies used : For design pattern i used MVC (Model , Vue , Controller), for programming language i used Java/JEE, to manipulate the data i used MySQL and in front end i used HTML5,CSS3&Bootstrap, JavaScript and frameworks of JS like JQuery and Ajax. Also, to show the results, i interacted with Google Maps API (JSON Data) and to perform the query of the Google Maps API i used Java.net and gson package to manipulate json data.

You can find how the project looks like in UI file.
